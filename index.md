# Frontend Templates

This directory contains templates for building new features and components in the Blackbear Platform frontend. These templates provide a starting point for implementing consistent patterns across the application.

## Available Templates

### Feature Template

The [[README|Feature Template]] provides a directory structure and example files for creating new features following our feature-based architecture. It includes:

- Component examples
- Composable patterns
- Service implementation patterns
- Type definitions
- View components

### Architecture Templates

- [[adr-template|ADR Template]] - Template for creating new Architectural Decision Records

## Using Templates

When implementing a new feature or component:

1. Copy the appropriate template to your working directory
2. Rename files and components to match your feature
3. Implement the required functionality
4. Ensure all tests pass before integration

## Best Practices

- Follow the structure and naming conventions demonstrated in the templates
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Document your code with clear comments
- Create tests for all functionality
